    "\n",
    "Scikit-learn (`sklearn`) is the main Python package for machine learning. It is a widely-used and well-regarded package. However, there are a couple of challenges to using it given the usual `pandas`-based data munging pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `sklearn` requires that all inputs be numeric, and in fact, `numpy` arrays.\n",
    "1. `sklearn` requires that all categorical variables by replaced by 0/1 dummy variables\n",
    "1. `sklearn` requires us to separate the predictors from the outcome. We need to have one `X` matrix for the predictors and one `y` vector for the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The big issue, of course, is the first point. Given we used `pandas` precisely because we wanted to be able to keep heterogenous data. We have to be able to convert non-numeric data to numeric. `pandas` does help us out with this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First of all, we know that all `pandas` Series and DataFrame objects can be converted to `numpy` arrays using the `values` or `to_numpy` functions. \n",
    "1. Second, we can easily extract a single variable from the data set using either the usual extracton methods or the \n",
    "`pop` function. \n",
    "1. Third, `pandas` gives us a way to convert all categorical values to numeric dummy variables using the `get_dummies` function. This is actually a more desirable solution than what you will see in cyberspace, which is to use the \n",
    "`OneHotEncoder` function from `sklearn`. \n",
    "    + This is generally fine since many machine learning models look for interactions internally and don't need them to be overtly specified. The main exceptions to this are linear and logistic regression. For those, we can use the formula methods described in the Statistical Modeling module to generate the appropriately transformed design matrix.\n",
    "    + If the outcome variable is not numeric, we can `LabelEncoder` function from the `sklearn.preprocessing` submodule to convert it. \n",
    "\n",
    "I just threw a bunch of jargon at you. Let's see what this means.\n",
