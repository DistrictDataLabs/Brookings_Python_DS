    "The Python Data Stack comprises a set of packages that makes Python a powerful data science language. These include\n",

    "+ Numpy: provides arrays and matrix algebra\n",
    "+ Scipy: provides scientific computing capabilities\n",
    "+ matplotlib: provides graphing capabilities\n",

    "These were the original stack that was meant to replace Matlab. However, these were meant to tackle purely numerical data, and the kinds of heterogeneous data we regularly face needed more tools. These were added more recently.\n",

    "+ Pandas: provides data analytic structures like the data frame, as well as basic descriptive statistical capabilities\n",
    "+ statsmodels: provides a fairly comprehensive set of statistical functions\n",
    "+ scikit-learn: provides machine learning capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the basic stack of packages we will be using in this workshop. Additionally we will use a few packages that add some functionality to the data science process. These include\n",

    "+ plotly: Interactive graphics\n",

    "It's important to understand numpy and arrays, since most data sets we encounter are rectangular. The notations and operations we saw in numpy will translate to data, except for the fact that data is typically heterogeneous, i.e., of different types. The problem with using numpy for modern data analysis is that if you have mixed data types, it will all be coerced to strings, and then you can't actually do any data analysis. \n",
